## How Forest Admin Works

Forest Admin works through an **agent**—a lightweight backend application that sits between your data and the Forest Admin UI.

**What the agent does:**
- Connects to your databases and APIs
- Handles authentication and permissions
- Executes your business logic (Smart Actions, Smart Fields)
- Translates Forest Admin UI requests into database queries

<Info>
**Important:** The agent is the only component that accesses your data. Forest Admin UI never connects directly to your database.
</Info>

## Deployment Options

To install Forest Admin, you need to decide **where to run the agent**:

|  | **Cloud** | **Self-Hosted** | **On-Premise** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Architecture** | ![Cloud](/assets/architecture-cloud.svg) | ![Self-Hosted](/assets/architecture-self-hosted.svg) | ![On-Premise](/assets/architecture-on-premise.svg) |
| **What** | We host the agent | You host the agent | You host everything |
| **Best for** | Quick POC, startups | Private networks, compliance | Air-gapped, maximum security |
| **Requirements** | Internet-accessible DB | Node.js 18+ or Ruby 3+ | Enterprise license |
