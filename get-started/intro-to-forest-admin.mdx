Forest Admin is an **admin panel builder** that connects to your existing databases and APIs. Instead of spending months building internal tools, your team gets a fully-functional admin interface in minutes.

**From data to admin panel:** Connect your database → Get CRUD operations, role-based access, and workflows → Customize with business logic and branding.

**Core capabilities:**
- **Data operations** — Browse, search, create, edit, delete records
- **Custom business logic** — Add actions, computed fields, workflows
- **Access control** — Roles, permissions, SSO, audit logs
- **UI customization** — Layouts, forms, dashboards, branding
- **Team collaboration** — Notes, approval workflows, notifications

## How it works

Forest Admin uses an **agent-based architecture**. An agent runs in your infrastructure (or ours) and connects to your data sources. Your team accesses the Forest Admin UI to manage data.

```
Your Database ←→ Forest Admin Agent ←→ Forest Admin UI
                 (Node.js or Ruby)        (Web Interface)
```

**The agent handles:**
- Database connections and queries
- Business logic (actions, computed fields)
- Permission enforcement

**The UI provides:**
- Data browsing and editing
- Forms and layouts
- Dashboards and analytics
- User management

<Info>
**Your data never leaves your control.** The agent reads/writes directly to your database. We don't store your data.
</Info>


## Common use cases

**Customer Support** — View profiles, process refunds, manage subscriptions, handle tickets

**Operations** — Track orders, manage inventory, monitor KPIs, generate reports

**Content Moderation** — Review user content, manage catalogs, schedule publications

**Workflows & Approvals** — KYC/AML compliance, fraud detection, approval processes
