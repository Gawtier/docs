## How Learning Paths Work

Each path is a **structured journey** that guides you through relevant guides in a logical order. You'll learn by doing, with hands-on examples and real-world use cases.

**What you'll get:**
- Step-by-step progression from basics to advanced
- Links to relevant guides and documentation
- Practical examples and use cases
- Clear next steps after each milestone

## Not Sure Which Path to Choose?

- **Developers** → Building features, writing code, customizing the agent
- **Operations** → Using the UI daily, managing data, creating workflows
- **Product/Business** → Understanding capabilities, designing experiences, measuring success

You can always switch paths or explore multiple paths!
