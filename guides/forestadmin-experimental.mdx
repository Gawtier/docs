Forest Admin experimental is the community-driven repository where developers share datasources, plugins, and integrations with the broader Forest Admin ecosystem.

## What is Forest Admin experimental?

[Forest Admin experimental](https://github.com/ForestAdmin/forestadmin-experimental) is a monorepo containing community-built packages that extend Forest Admin's capabilities. These packages are maintained by the community and Forest Admin team, providing specialized integrations for popular services and platforms.

Unlike native datasources that are built directly into Forest Admin agents, experimental packages are:
- **Community-driven** - Built and maintained by Forest Admin users
- **Specialized** - Focused on specific platforms or use cases
- **Experimental** - May have limitations or be in active development
- **Open source** - Anyone can contribute improvements

## Current community datasources

The experimental repository currently includes:

- **[@forestadmin-experimental/datasource-elasticsearch](https://github.com/ForestAdmin/forestadmin-experimental/tree/main/packages/datasource-elasticsearch)** - Connect to Elasticsearch indices
- **[@forestadmin-experimental/datasource-hubspot-translation](https://github.com/ForestAdmin/forestadmin-experimental/tree/main/packages/datasource-hubspot-translation)** - Read HubSpot CRM data

## Contributing your datasource

If you've built a datasource for your own needs, consider sharing it with the community through Forest Admin experimental.

### When to contribute

Consider contributing when:
- You've built a datasource for a popular service (Salesforce, Airtable, Notion, etc.)
- Your datasource solves a common integration problem
- You're willing to maintain the package and respond to issues
- The integration would benefit other Forest Admin users

### Contribution process

1. **Build your datasource** - Create a working datasource using Forest Admin's datasource SDK
2. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure it works reliably with real data
3. **Document your code** - Add clear README with installation, configuration, and examples
4. **Open a pull request** - Submit to [forestadmin-experimental](https://github.com/ForestAdmin/forestadmin-experimental)
5. **Collaborate** - Work with maintainers to refine and publish

### Package requirements

Your datasource package should include:

- **Clear README** - Installation, basic usage, configuration options
- **TypeScript types** - Full type definitions for better DX
- **Tests** - Unit tests covering core functionality
- **Examples** - Working example code
- **License** - MIT license (consistent with Forest Admin)

## Example: Elasticsearch datasource

The Elasticsearch datasource is a great example of a community contribution:

```typescript
import { createElasticsearchDataSource } from '@forestadmin-experimental/datasource-elasticsearch';

agent.addDataSource(
  createElasticsearchDataSource({
    node: 'http://localhost:9200',
    auth: {
      username: 'elastic',
      password: 'password'
    },
    indices: [
      {
        name: 'products',
        fields: {
          id: { type: 'Number' },
          name: { type: 'String' },
          price: { type: 'Number' }
        }
      }
    ]
  })
);
```

This package provides full CRUD operations, filtering, and aggregations for Elasticsearch indices—all maintained by the community.
