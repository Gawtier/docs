## The `.forestadmin-schema.json` file

In your **Development Environments only**, on server start, a `.forestadmin-schema.json` file will be auto-generated. It reflects:

- the **state of your data sources Collections.**
- your **Agent customization**.

<Info>
This file **must be versioned and deployed** for any Remote (test, staging, qa, preprod,...) or Production Environment, as it will be the foundation of your Forest Admin layouts.
</Info>

<Info>
We use the option `isProduction` in the `createAgent` function. You can use `isProduction: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'` to control this behavior. Setting this variable to `false` will regenerate a new `.forestadmin-schema.json` file every time your app restarts. Using `true` will never regenerate the file.
</Info>

<Warning>
As a consequence, in Remote and Production Environments, the `.forestadmin-schema.json` file does **not** update according to your data sources schema and customization changes (but follows the `.forestadmin-schema.json` file versioned in the code you deployed).
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Do not edit this file manually**, as it could break your interface if the wrong syntax is used.
</Warning>

Versioning the`.forestadmin-schema.json` file will also help you visualize your admin panel configuration changes.
