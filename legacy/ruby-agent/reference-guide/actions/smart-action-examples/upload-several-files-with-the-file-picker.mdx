# Upload several files with the File Picker

**Smart action**

If you set an input field as an array of strings (\['String']), you can use the file picker to upload several files at once.

The following example shows you how to define an action allowing for the upload of several files.

In your forest/your-model.js file, add the following:

jsx
multipleDocumentPath: {
      type: DataTypes.ARRAY(DataTypes.STRING),
    },
```

```jsx
multipleDocumentPath: [String];
```

<Info>
💡 In order to be able to load several files that may be heavy, you will need to edit your app.js file as explained [here](https://community.forestadmin.com/t/maximum-file-size-in-a-smart-action-field-file/173/4?u=philippeg).
