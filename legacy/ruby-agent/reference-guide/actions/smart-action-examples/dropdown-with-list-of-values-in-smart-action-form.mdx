# Dropdown with list of values in smart action form

**Context**: Within a smart action form, I want to enable my users to choose the value of an input field within a set of predefined values.

Here I have a smart action called `change status` for the collection `companies`. I want users to be able to only select the new status from a list of possible options.

`forest/companies.js`
