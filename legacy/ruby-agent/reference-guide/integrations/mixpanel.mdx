# Mixpanel

The Mixpanel integration allows you to fetch Mixpanel’s events and display them at a record level into Forest.

### Rails
To benefit from Mixpanel integration, you need to add the `gem 'mixpanel_client'` to your Gemfile.

Then, add the following code to your initializer. In our example we will map the `Customer.email` with the data coming from Mixpanel. You may replace by your own relevant collection(s).

By default, Mixpanel is sending the following fields: id, event, date, city, region, country, timezone, os, osVersion, browser, browserVersion. If you want to add other fields from Mixpanel, you have to add them in `customProperties`:

```ruby
ForestLiana.env_secret = Rails.application.secrets.forest_env_secret
ForestLiana.auth_secret = Rails.application.secrets.forest_auth_secret

ForestLiana.integrations = {
  mixpanel: {
    api_key: 'YOUR MIXPANEL API KEY',
    api_secret: 'YOUR MIXPANEL SECRET KEY',
    mapping: ['Customer.email'],
    custom_properties: ['Campaign Source', 'plan', 'tutorial complete'],
  }
}
```

You will then be able to see the Mixpanel events on a record, a `Customer` in our example.
