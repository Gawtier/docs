# Display Dwolla funding sources

## 1. Define the smart collection

Filterable fields are flagged using `isFilterable: true`. You will need to enable this option using the collection settings in the [Layout Editor](https://docs.forestadmin.com/user-guide/getting-started/master-your-ui/using-the-layout-editor-mode).&#x20;

Funding Sources have the `onlyForRelationships` enabled: it means that these 2 collections are only accessible via the Dwolla customer relationships.


## 2. Implement the route

This route use the Dwolla service described in [another section](dwolla-service.md).
