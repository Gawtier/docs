# Display Dwolla transfers

{/* markdown-link-check-disable */}

This example shows you how to create a smart collection to list the transfers of your [Dwolla](https://www.dwolla.com) account.

{/* markdown-link-check-enable */}

## 1. Define the smart collection

Filterable fields are flagged using `isFilterable: true`. You will need to enable this option using the collection settings in the [Layout Editor](https://docs.forestadmin.com/user-guide/getting-started/master-your-ui/using-the-layout-editor-mode).&#x20;

Transfers have the `onlyForRelationships` enabled: it means that these 2 collections are only accessible via the Dwolla customer relationships.


## 2. Implement the route

This route use the Dwolla service described in [another section](dwolla-service.md).
