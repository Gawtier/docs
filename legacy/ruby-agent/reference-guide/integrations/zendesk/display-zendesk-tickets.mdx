# Display Zendesk tickets

This section shows you how to create a smart collection to list the tickets of your Zendesk account.

### Declare the Smart Collection Zendesk Tickets&#x20;

First, we need to declare the smart collection in your project based on the API documentation. As an example, here the smart collection definition for Users:


<Info>
Some fields are available for filtering or sorting using the Zendesk API. To allow this on the Forest UI, simply add the keywords `isFilterable` and `isSortable` in your field definition.
</Info>

### Implement the Smart Collection route

In the file `routes/zendesk-tickets.js`, we’ve created a new route to implement the API behind the Smart Collection.

The logic here is to list all the users of your Zendesk account.

<Info>

- Learn more about how to [authenticate, filter and sort with the Zendesk API](https://docs.forestadmin.com/woodshop/how-tos/zendesk-integration/authentication-filtering-and-sorting).
- Find more information about `getTickets` variable definition in [the Github repository](https://github.com/existenz31/forest-zendesk/blob/master/services/zendesk-tickets-service.js).
</Info>


### Implement the get Route

The section above help you display the list of all Zendesk tickets. But you'll need to implement also the logic to display the information of a specific ticket.

This is going to be very similar. We just need to implement a new endpoint to get an individual ticket from the Zendesk API.

```javascript
async function getTicket(request, response, next) {
  return axios
    .get(
      `${ZENDESK_URL_PREFIX}/api/v2/tickets/${request.params.ticketId}?include=comment_count`,
      {
        headers: {
          Authorization: `Basic ${getToken()}`,
        },
      }
    )
    .then(async (resp) => {
      let record = resp.data.ticket;
      // Serialize the result using the Forest Admin format
      const recordSerializer = new RecordSerializer({
        name: 'zendesk_tickets',
      });
      const recordSerialized = await recordSerializer.serialize(record);
      response.send(recordSerialized);
    })
    .catch(next);
}
```

```javascript
const {
  getTickets,
  getTicket,
} = require('../services/zendesk-tickets-service');

// Get a Zendesk Ticket
router.get(
  '/zendesk_tickets/:ticketId',
  permissionMiddlewareCreator.details(),
  (request, response, next) => {
    getTicket(request, response, next);
  }
);
```
