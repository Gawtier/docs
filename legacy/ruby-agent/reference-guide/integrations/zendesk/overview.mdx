For this example we will use the Zendesk API described [here](https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api/docs/support/introduction).&#x20;

We are going to use [Smart Collections](../../smart-collections/), [Smart Relationships](../../models/relationships/create-a-smart-relationship/), and [Smart Fields](../../smart-fields/) to implement such integration.
