# Send Smart Action notifications to Slack

This example shows you how to integrate [Slack incoming webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) to receive notifications in your workspace when a Smart Action e.g `"Reject application"` is triggered.

Demo

## Create your Forest Admin slack app

Follow Slack's guide to [create a new app](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) in your workspace and start sending messages using Incoming Webhooks.

Once your Slack app has its shiny Incoming Webhook URL, you will be able to send your [message](https://api.slack.com/messages) in JSON as the body of an `application/json` POST request.

```
https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID/YOUR_CHANNEL_ID/YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN
```

## Connect your app from a Slack channel of your choice
