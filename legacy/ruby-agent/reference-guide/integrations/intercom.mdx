# Intercom

Configuring the Intercom integration allows you to display your user’s session data (location, browser type, …) and conversations.

<Warning>
In order for your intercom integration to work properly, you will have to use the version 2 of intercom API. To do so, you'll need go to the intercom developer hub and ensure that the app registered to retrieve your API key uses the intercom API version 2.0.
</Warning>

First, add the intercom client as a dependency to your project:

### Rails

```ruby
gem 'intercom'
```

Then, you need to add the intercom integration:

### Rails

```ruby
ForestLiana.integrations = {
  # ...
  intercom: {
    access_token: ENV['INTERCOM_ACCESS_TOKEN'],
    mapping: ['Customer']
  }
}
```

- `intercom` is used to pass the intercom client version. To do so, you have to require the previously installed client, as in the example.
- `accessToken` should be defined in your environment variable and is provided by intercom.
- `mapping` refers to the collection and field name you want to map to intercom data. It can either be a field that contain emails that refer to intercom users or a field that contain ids mapping the `external_id` in Intercom API.

<Info>
You will have to restart your server to see Intercom plugged to your project.
