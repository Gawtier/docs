# Elasticsearch service/utils

## Connecting to Elasticsearch with a Custom Service

This service wraps the [Elasticsearch Node.js client](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/index.html) and provides the following implementation:

- Get a list of records (with Pagination and Filters handling)
- Get a simple record
- Create a record
- Update an existing record
- Delete a record

### Prototype


<Warning>
We expose utils to parse filters through **forest-express-sequelize** since version **7.6.0**
