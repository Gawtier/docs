# Razorpay

**Context**: As a user I want to be able to see all payments and orders related to a customer from Razorpay.

**Example**: I have a collection `users` and a collection `orders` in the database. An order belongs to a customer through a field `user`. An order has a field `order_reference` and `payment_reference` that are ids of objects from Razorpay.

### Models

`models/users.js`


`forest/razorpay-orders.js`


#### Add relationships to virtual collections

You need to declare a relationship between the `users` collection and the virtual `razorpayPayments` and `razorpayOrders` collections in the `forest/users.js` file.


### Define route logic for the relationship

You now have to implement the logic to be executed to retrieve and send the information from Razorpay to the UI when the corresponding route is called.

This is done in the file `routes/users.js.` Remember that you need to properly serialize the objects in order for the UI to correctly display them, using the `RecordsSerializer`.
