## Requirements

- An admin backend running on forest-express-sequelize
- [superagent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/superagent) npm package
- a Hubspot account

## How it works

### Directory: /models

This directory contains the `companies.js` file where the collection is declared.


### Directory: /routes

This directory contains the `companies.js` file where the smart action logic is implemented.&#x20;

In this logic a Hubspot company instance is created through a /post create company call to the Hubspot API.

<Info>
The Hubspot API key is defined in the `.env` file and requested through the expression `process.env.HUBSPOT_API`.
