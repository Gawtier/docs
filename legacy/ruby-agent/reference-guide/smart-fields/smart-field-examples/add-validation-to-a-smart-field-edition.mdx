# Add validation to a smart field edition

**Context**: I want to make sure that my users can only enter a value satisfying a certain set of conditions when editing a smart field.

Here I'm working on a collection `customers` and the smart field `'must-be-kuku'` should only accept the value `kuku`.

`forest/customers.js`


At the route level I need to check the user input from the edit form in the UI and check the value that has been entered into the field `'must-be-kuku'`.

`routes/customers.js`
