# Smart relationship between model and stripe cards

**Context**: as a user I want to display stripe cards associated to a user using the Stripe API.

### Implementation

First step is to declare the smart collection user_stripe_cards in a `user-stripe-cards.js` file in the forest folder.


Next step is to add the smart relationship between users and stripe cards in the `forest/users.js` file.
