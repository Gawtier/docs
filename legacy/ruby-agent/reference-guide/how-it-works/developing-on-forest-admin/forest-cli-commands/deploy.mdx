# deploy

The `forest deploy` command enables you to apply some layout changes to your [reference](../using-branches.md#what-is-a-branch) environment.

```
$ forest deploy --help

Deploy layout changes of the current branch to the reference one.

USAGE
  forest deploy

OPTIONS
  --force                  Skip confirmations.
  --help                   Display usage information.
```

### Deploying your changes

It is paramount to understand this command before using it:

As you can see in the above figure, the layout changes (Δ) located in your local branch `my-branch` will be **irreversibly applied** to your Production layout. Since your remotes' layout are based on your production's layout, the changes will appear there too.

To deploy, simply run `forest deploy`:

```
$ forest deploy
```

<Info>
To be able to deploy the origin of the branch should be the reference environment (eg: production)
</Info>

### Deploy from the UI

This is possible **only from a remote** which have the reference environment as origin:

To deploy your latest layout changes from a remote environment, you may use the **top banner link**: "Deploy to ...".
