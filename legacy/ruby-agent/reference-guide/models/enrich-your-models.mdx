title: Enrich your models

  ⚠️ This page is relevant only if you installed Forest Admin directly on a
  database (SQL/Mongodb). If you installed in a Rails/Django/Laravel app, you
  manage your models like you normally would.

# Enrich your models

### Declaring a new model

Whenever you have a new table/collection in your database, you will have to create file to declare it. Here is a **template example** for a `companies` table:

### Declaring a new field in a model

Any new field must be added **manually** within the corresponding model of your `/models` folder.

### Managing nested documents in Mongoose

<Info>
For a better user experience, you can [Flatten nested fields](../../how-tos/setup/flatten-nested-fields-mongodb.md).
</Info>

Lumber introspects your data structure recursively, so _**nested fields**_ (object in object) are detected any level deep. Your **sub-documents** (array of nested fields) are detected as well.

<Warning>
Conflicting data types will result in the generation of a [mixed](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/schematypes.html#mixed) type field.
</Warning>

The following model...


...will result in the following interface:

### Removing a model

By default **all** tables/collections in your database are analyzed by Lumber to generate your models. If you want to exclude some of them to prevent them from appearing in your Forest, check out [this how-to](../../how-tos/settings/include-exclude-models.md).

### Adding validation to your models

Validation allows you to keep control over your data's quality and integrity.

<Info>
If your existing app already has validation conditions, you may - or may not - want to reproduce the same validation conditions in your admin backend's models.&#x20;

If so, you'll have to do it **manually**, using the below examples.
</Info>

Depending on your database type, your models will have been generated in _Sequelize_ (for SQL databases) or _Mongoose_ (for Mongo databases).

###

### Adding a default value to your models

You can choose to add a default value for some fields in your models. As a result, the corresponding fields will be prefilled with their default value in the creation form:

### Adding a hook

Hooks are a powerful mechanism which allow you to automatically **trigger an event** at specific moments in your records lifecycle.&#x20;

In our case, let's pretend we want to update a `update_count` field every time a record is updated:
