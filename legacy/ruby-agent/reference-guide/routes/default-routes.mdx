title: Default routes

  ⚠️ This page is relevant only if you installed Forest Admin directly on a
  database (SQL/Mongodb). If you installed in a Rails app, the default routes
  are managed within your Rails app.

# Default routes

Forest Admin's default routes are generated in the `routes` folder at installation.

Below we've detailed what the `next()` statement does. Those snippets can be used when overriding those routes, as explained [here](override-a-route.md).

### Create a record


### Update a record


<Info>
Note that the **update** of `belongsTo` fields is managed by [another route](default-routes.md#relationship-routes).
</Info>

### Delete a record


### Get a list of records


### Get a number of records


### Get a record


### Export a list of records


### Delete a list of records


### Other available routes

Some other routes exist but are not generated automatically because it's less likely that you'll need to extend or override them.

Here is the list:

#### Relationship routes

**GET** /forest/{modelName}/{id}/relationships/{hasManyRelationName}\
⟶ **List** has many relationships

**GET** /forest/{modelName}/{id}/relationships/{hasManyRelationName}/count\
⟶ **Count** has many relationships

**PUT** /forest/{modelName}/{id}/relationships/{belongsToRelationName}\
⟶ **Update** a belongs to field

**POST** /forest/{modelName}/{id}/relationships/{hasManyRelationName}\
⟶ **Add** existing records to has many relationship

**GET** /forest/{modelName}/{id}/relationships/{hasManyRelationName}.csv\
⟶ **Export** all has many relationships

**PUT** /forest/{modelName}/{id}/relationships/{embeddedRelationName}/{index}\
⟶ **Update** an embedded document (inside a list)

**DELETE** /forest/{modelName}/{id}/relationships/{hasManyRelationName}\
⟶ **Dissociate** records from relations

#### Action routes

**POST** /forest/actions/{actionNameDasherized}/values\
⟶ **Get** the default values for this action
