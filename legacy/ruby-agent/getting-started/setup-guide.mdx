# Quick start

### Step 1: Create an account and follow the onboarding

Go to [https://app.forestadmin.com/signup](https://app.forestadmin.com/signup), create an account and install your project.

<Info>
For the purpose of this tutorial, we have used [this database](../how-tos/databases/use-a-demo-database.md). Feel free to use it if you don't have one.
</Info>

At the end of your onboarding, you will **out-of-the-box** be able to:

* Access all your data **(1)**
* Export your data **(2)**
* Add a record **(3)**
* View and edit a record **(4)**
* Edit your UI **(5)**
* Search and filter **(6)**

However, your business logic likely requires more features. What if you need to...

* refund an order
* upload new documents, accept or reject them, or ask customers to update their documents,
* contact a customer or ask a team member to perform an action,
* and much more?

It's possible with **smart actions** :point_down:

### Step 2: Create a Smart Action

Let's say you want to let your customer support team to easily refund orders, you can quickly create a smart action.

### Rails
Declare it in your `/lib/forest_liana/collections/order.rb` file:

```ruby
class Forest::Order
  include ForestLiana::Collection

  collection :Order

  action 'Refund order'
end
```

Then declare the corresponding route:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # MUST be declared before the mount ForestLiana::Engine.
  namespace :forest do
    post '/actions/refund-order' => 'orders#refund_order'
  end

  mount ForestLiana::Engine => '/forest'
end
```

Lastly, implement the action according to your business logic:

```ruby
class Forest::OrdersController < ForestLiana::SmartActionsController
  def refund_order
    # Add your own logic, like calling a Stripe API for instance
    render json: { success: 'Order refunded!' }
  end
end
```

<Warning>
You must make sure that all your Smart Actions controllers extend from the `ForestLiana::SmartActionsController`. This is mandatory to ensure that all features built on top of Smart Actions work as expected (authentication, permissions, approval workflows,...)
</Warning>

<Info>
You may have to [add CORS headers](../how-tos/setup/configuring-cors-headers.md) to enable the domain `app.forestadmin.com` to trigger API call on your Application URL, which is on a different domain name (e.g. _localhost:8000_).
</Info>

### Django
Declare it in your `app/forest/orders.py` file:


Ensure the file app/forest/\_\_init\_\_.py exists and contains the import of the previous defined class :


Make sure your **project** `urls.py` file include you app urls with the `forest` prefix.

```javascript
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('forest', include('app.urls')),
    path('forest', include('django_forest.urls')),
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]
```

Then declare the corresponding route:

```javascript
from django.urls import path
from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exempt

from . import views

app_name = 'app'
urlpatterns = [
    path('/actions/refund-order', csrf_exempt(views.RefundOrderView.as_view()), name='refund-order'),
]
```

Lastly, implement the action according to your business logic:


Note that Forest Admin takes care of the authentication thanks to the `ActionView` parent class view.

<Info>
You may have to [add CORS headers](../how-tos/setup/configuring-cors-headers.md) to enable the domain `app.forestadmin.com` to trigger API call on your Application URL, which is on a different domain name (e.g. _localhost:8000_).
</Info>

### Laravel
Declare it in your `app/Models/Order.php` file:


Then declare the corresponding route:


Lastly, implement the action according to your business logic:


<Check>
Congrats! Now it's possible to refund an order!
</Check>

### Step 3: Deploy to Production

Now that you have a fully functional admin panel, the next logical step is to **make it live**, with your live (production) data. Click on **Deploy to Production** and follow the flow.

<Check>
That's it! You are now fully operational on Forest Admin.
