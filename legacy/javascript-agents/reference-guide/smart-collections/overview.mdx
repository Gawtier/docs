# Smart Collections

### What is a Smart Collection?

A Smart Collection is a Forest Collection based on your API implementation. It allows you to reconcile fields of data coming from different or external sources in a single tabular view (by default), without having to physically store them into your database.

Fields of data could be coming from many other sources such as other B2B SaaS (e.g. Zendesk, Salesforce, Stripe), in-memory database, message broker, etc.

<Info>
This is an **advanced** notion. If you're just starting with Forest Admin, you should skip this for now.
</Info>

In the following example, we have created a **Smart Collection** called `customer_stats`allowing us to see all customers who have placed orders, the number of order placed and the total amount of those orders.

**For an example of advanced customization and featuring an Amazon S3 integration,** you can see [here](examples/amazon-s3-integration-example.md) how we've stored in our live demo the companies' legal documents on Amazon S3 and how we've implemented a **Smart Collection** to access and manipulate them.

### Creating a Smart Collection

### SQL
First, we declare the `customer_stats` collection in the `forest/` directory.

In this Smart Collection, we want to display for each customer its email address, the number of orders made (in a field `orders_count`) and the sum of the price of all those orders (in a field `total_amount`).

You can check out the list of [available field options ](../smart-fields/#available-field-options)if you need it.

<Warning>
You **MUST** declare an `id` field when creating a Smart Collection. The value of this field for each record **MUST** be unique.

As we are using the _customer id_ in this example, we do not need to declare an `id` manually.
</Warning>

```javascript
const { collection } = require('forest-express-sequelize');
const models = require('../models');

collection('customer_stats', {
  isSearchable: true,
  fields: [
    {
      field: 'email',
      type: 'String',
    },
    {
      field: 'orders_count',
      type: 'Number',
    },
    {
      field: 'total_amount',
      type: 'Number',
    },
  ],
});
```

<Info>
The option`isSearchable: true` added to your collection allows to display the search bar. Note that you will have to implement the search yourself by including it into your own `get` logic.
</Info>

### Mongodb
_Work in progress - this section will soon be released_

### Rails
First, we declare the `CustomerStat` collection in the `lib/forest-liana/collections/` directory.

In this Smart Collection, we want to display for each customer its email address, the number of orders made (in a field `orders_count`) and the sum of the price of all those orders (in a field `total_amount`).

You can check out the list of [available field options ](../smart-fields/#available-field-options)if you need it.

<Warning>
You **MUST** declare an `id` field when creating a Smart Collection. The value of this field for each record **MUST** be unique.

As we are using the _customer id_ in this example, we do not need to declare an `id` manually.
</Warning>

ruby
class Forest::CustomerStatsController < ForestLiana::ApplicationController
  require 'jsonapi-serializers'

  before_action :set_params, only: [:index]

  class BaseSerializer
    include JSONAPI::Serializer

    def type
      'customerStat'
    end

    def format_name(attribute_name)
      attribute_name.to_s.underscore
    end

    def unformat_name(attribute_name)
      attribute_name.to_s.dasherize
    end
  end

  class CustomerStatSerializer < BaseSerializer
    attribute :email
    attribute :total_amount
    attribute :orders_count
  end

  def index
    customers_count = Customer.count_by_sql("
      SELECT COUNT(*)
      FROM customers
      WHERE
        EXISTS (
          SELECT *
          FROM orders
          WHERE orders.customer_id = customers.id
        )
        AND email LIKE '%#{@search}%'
    ")
    customer_stats = Customer.find_by_sql("
      SELECT customers.id,
        customers.email,
        count(orders.*) AS orders_count,
        sum(products.price) AS total_amount,
        customers.created_at,
        customers.updated_at
      FROM customers
      JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id
      JOIN products ON orders.product_id = products.id
      WHERE email LIKE '%#{@search}%'
      GROUP BY customers.id
      ORDER BY customers.id
      LIMIT #{@limit}
      OFFSET #{@offset}
    ")
    customer_stats_json = CustomerStatSerializer.serialize(customer_stats, is_collection: true, meta: {count: customers_count})
    render json: customer_stats_json
  end

  private

  def set_params
    @limit = params[:page][:size].to_i
    @offset = (params[:page][:number].to_i - 1) * @limit
    @search = sanitize_sql_like(params[:search]? params[:search] : "")
  end

  def sanitize_sql_like(string, escape_character = "\\")
    pattern = Regexp.union(escape_character, "%", "_")
    string.gsub(pattern) { |x| [escape_character, x].join }
  end
end
```

You then need to create a route pointing to your collection's index action to get all your collection's records.

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # MUST be declared before the mount ForestLiana::Engine.
  namespace :forest do
    get '/CustomerStat' => 'customer_stats#index'
  end

  mount ForestLiana::Engine => '/forest'

end
```

### Django
First we will add the right path to the **urls.py** file


Then we will create the pertained view


### Laravel
Create a controller `CustomerStatsController`


Then add the route.


Now we are all set, we can access the Smart Collection as any other collection.

<Info>
In this example we have only implemented the **GET all records** action but you can also add the following actions: **GET specific records**, **PUT, DELETE** and **POST**. These are shown in the next page explaining how a Smart Collection can be used to access and manipulate data stored in Amazon S3.
