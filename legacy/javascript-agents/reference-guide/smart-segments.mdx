# Smart Segments

### What is a Smart Segment?

A **Segment** is a subset of a collection: it's basically a saved filter of your collection.

Segments are designed for those who want to _systematically_ visualize data according to specific sets of filters. It allows you to save your filters configuration so you don’t have to compute the same actions every day.

A **Smart Segments** is useful when you want to use a complex filter, which you'll add as code in your backend.

### Creating a Smart Segment

Sometimes, segment filters are complicated and closely tied to your business. Forest Admin allows you to code how the segment is computed.

On our Live Demo example, we’ve implemented a Smart Segment on the collection `products` to allow admin users to see the bestsellers at a glance.

### SQL
You’re free to implement the business logic you need. The only requirement is to return a valid Sequelize condition. Most of the time, your Smart Segment should return something like `{ id: { in: [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] } }`.

On our implementation, we use a raw SQL query to filter and sort the product that was sold the most.

```javascript
const { collection } = require('forest-express-sequelize');
const models = require('../models');

const { Op, QueryTypes } = models.objectMapping;

collection('products', {
  segments: [
    {
      name: 'Bestsellers',
      where: (product) => {
        return models.connections.default
          .query(
            `
        SELECT products.id, COUNT(orders.*)
        FROM products
        JOIN orders ON orders.product_id = products.id
        GROUP BY products.id
        ORDER BY count DESC
        LIMIT 5;
      `,
            { type: QueryTypes.SELECT }
          )
          .then((products) => {
            let productIds = products.map((product) => product.id);
            return { id: { [Op.in]: productIds } };
          });
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

### Mongodb
You’re free to implement the business logic you need. Your Smart Segment should return something like `{ _id: { $in: [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] } }`.

```javascript
const { collection } = require('forest-express-mongoose');
const { Product } = require('../models');

collection('Product', {
  fields: [
    {
      field: 'buyers',
      type: ['String'],
      reference: 'Customer',
    },
  ],
  segments: [
    {
      name: 'Bestsellers',
      where: (product) => {
        return Product.aggregate([
          {
            $project: { orders_count: { $size: { $ifNull: ['$orders', []] } } },
          },
          {
            $sort: { orders_count: -1 },
          },
          {
            $limit: 5,
          },
        ]).then((products) => {
          let productIds = [];
          products
            .filter((product) => {
              if (product._id.length === 0) {
                return false;
              }
              return true;
            })
            .forEach((product) => {
              productIds.push(product._id);
            });
          return { _id: { $in: productIds } };
        });
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

### Rails

```ruby
class Forest::Product
  include ForestLiana::Collection

  collection :Product

  segment 'Bestsellers' do
    productIds = Product.joins(:orders).group('products.id').order('count(orders.id)').limit(10).pluck('products.id')

    { id: productIds }
  end
end
```

### Django


Ensure the file app/forest/\_\_init\_\_.py exists and contains the import of the previous defined class :

```python
from app.forest.product import ProductForest
```

### Laravel
<Info>
The 2nd parameter of the `SmartSegment` method is not required. If you don't fill it, the name of your SmartSegment will be the name of your method that wrap it.

### Setting up independent columns visibility

By default, Forest Admin applies the same configuration to all segments of the same collection.

However, the _Independent columns configuration_ option allows you to display different columns on your different segments.
