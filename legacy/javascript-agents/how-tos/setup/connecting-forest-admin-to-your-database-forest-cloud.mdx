### Provide database credentials

To connect Forest Admin to your database, you must enter the following authentication credentials:

### Set up tunneling for local databases

If your database is running locally (e.g., 127.0.0.1), you will need to use tunneling software to expose your local database to the internet. This will enable Forest Admin to connect to it. Some popular tunneling software options include:

- Ngrok
- Bastion
- Localtunnel

Choose a tunneling software that suits your needs and follow its documentation to set up the connection.
