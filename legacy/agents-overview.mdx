## Migration Effort

| Agent | Estimated Time | Complexity | Breaking Changes |
|-------|---------------|------------|------------------|
| forest-express-sequelize | 2-4 hours | Low | Minimal |
| forest-express-mongoose | 2-4 hours | Low | Minimal |
| forest-rails | 4-8 hours | Medium | Some API changes |
| django-forestadmin | 4-8 hours | Medium | Some API changes |

**Note:** These estimates are for typical projects. Complex customizations may require more time.

## What Changes in v2?

### Core Concepts (Same)
✅ Collections, fields, and relationships work the same way
✅ Smart Actions, Smart Fields, Smart Segments stay conceptual similar
✅ Permissions and roles configuration unchanged in UI
✅ Your Forest Admin UI configuration is preserved

### API Changes (Different)
- **Package names** - New package structure (`@forestadmin/agent`, `@forestadmin/datasource-*`)
- **Initialization** - New agent setup with datasource composition
- **Customization API** - New methods for Smart Actions, Fields, etc.
- **Hooks** - New hook system with better typing

### Migration Path

1. **Install new agent** - Add v2 packages alongside v1
2. **Copy datasource connection** - Reuse your database connection
3. **Migrate customizations** - Update Smart Actions, Fields, Segments one by one
4. **Test in parallel** - Run v1 and v2 side-by-side
5. **Switch to v2** - Update your environment variables
6. **Remove v1** - Uninstall v1 packages

**The good news:** You can migrate incrementally without downtime!

## FAQs

### Can I run v1 and v2 in parallel?
Yes! This is the recommended approach. You can run both agents on different ports during migration.

### Will my UI configuration be preserved?
Yes! All your layout, permissions, and settings are preserved.

### How long does migration take?
Most teams complete migration in 1-2 days for simple projects, up to 1 week for complex ones.

### What if I have many Smart Actions?
Migrate them one by one. The new API is similar but more powerful.

### Do I need to change my database?
No! Your database structure stays the same.

### Is there a migration tool?
We provide guides and code examples. Some parts can be automated, others require manual updates.
