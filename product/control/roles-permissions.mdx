## Overview

Forest Admin enables administrators to create and manage custom roles with granular permission controls. The roles system allows organizations to define what actions users can perform within the platform.

Only users with Admin permission level can create and manage roles. Roles are configured in the Roles tab within project settings, where you can establish permissions that apply to all users assigned to that role.

## Permission Levels

Forest Admin defines five user permission levels with increasing administrative capabilities:

*Based on collection and action permissions configured for the role

## Roles

Roles are configured in **Project Settings → Roles**. Each role defines granular permissions for collections and Smart Actions.

### Collection Permissions

Control what users can do with data in each collection:

| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Read (List)** | Access to table view data - allows users to see the list of records in a collection |
| **Read (Details)** | Access to details and summary view data for individual records - allows users to open and view a specific record's complete information |
| **Create** | Record creation capability, including the ability to duplicate existing records |
| **Update** | Modify existing records |
| **Delete** | Remove records permanently |
| **Export** | Export data from the collection in various formats (CSV, JSON, etc.) |

### Smart Action Permissions

Control user ability to trigger and approve Smart Actions:

| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Trigger** | Allow users assigned to this role to trigger this Smart Action - the basic execution permission |
| **Require Approval** | Smart actions won't execute without manual approval - creates an approval workflow where actions are queued and must be reviewed before execution |
| **Approve** | Permits role members to approve trigger requests submitted by other users - can review and authorize pending action requests |
| **Self Approve** | Allows users to approve their own action requests - bypasses the need for another user to review the action, useful for trusted users who need faster execution |

### Approval Workflows

When "Require Approval" is enabled for a Smart Action:

1. User triggers the action
2. Action enters pending state in the approval queue
3. Users with "Approve" permission review the request
4. Action executes once approved (or is cancelled if rejected)

This workflow ensures sensitive operations (like refunds, data exports, or account deletions) go through proper review before execution.

## Conditional Permissions

Restrict permissions based on data conditions using filters. For example, operators might trigger refunds under $1,000 without approval, while higher amounts require authorization.

Conditional permissions allow you to:
- Set data-based filters on any permission
- Create dynamic permission rules based on field values
- Combine multiple conditions with AND/OR logic
- Apply different permission levels based on record data

**Example:** Allow the "Support" role to trigger refunds only when `amount < 1000`, otherwise require approval.

## Default Permissions

Configure default permissions that are automatically applied when new collections or Smart Actions are created. This ensures consistent permission settings across your project without having to manually configure each new collection or action.

Default permissions are configured in **Project Settings → Roles** and apply to:
- New collections added to your datasources
- New Smart Actions created in the agent
- New fields added to existing collections

This saves time and ensures security by establishing baseline permissions that new elements inherit automatically.

## User Assignment

Administrators modify individual user roles and permission levels through the Users tab. Select the appropriate role and permission level for each user before saving changes.
