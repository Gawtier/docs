## Overview

Teams allow you to create different layouts for different groups within your organization. Each team can have its own customized interface, optimized for their specific workflows and priorities.

**Example use cases:**
- **Customer Support** might prioritize displaying transaction IDs in the first column and default to the Data tab
- **Sales team** would prefer showing company names first and default to the Dashboard tab
- **Operations** could have a layout focused on order fulfillment metrics and status tracking

Teams enable you to mirror your internal organizational structure within Forest Admin, ensuring each department sees the most relevant information for their daily work.

When combined with scopes, teams enable row-level security where users only see data relevant to their team context.

Teams are managed in **Project Settings → Teams**.

## Create a Team

To establish a new team, navigate to the Teams tab within your project settings and select "+ New team". When creating a team, you have the option to "optionally copy another team's layout".

## Team Layout Management

A team's layout encompasses all visible UI aspects that can be customized per team:

- **Workflows** - Custom workflows specific to the team
- **Inbox** - Team-specific inbox configuration
- **Workspaces** - Organized collections and navigation
- **Collection settings and widgets** - Including Smart Views, columns, and table configurations
- **Smart Actions visibility** - Which actions are visible to the team
- **Dashboards** - Custom dashboards with team-relevant metrics
- **Record settings** - Summary views, analytics per record, related data tabs

To apply an existing team's configuration to another team, access the team's settings page and use the "Copy" feature.

<Warning>
This action is irreversible, so review carefully before proceeding.
</Warning>

## Delete a Team

To remove a team, go to its settings page, scroll beneath the user list, and click "Delete this team". You'll be asked to retype the team name as a confirmation step.

<Warning>
This is a permanent action that cannot be undone.
</Warning>

## Advanced Use Cases

Teams unlock powerful use cases for different organizational needs:

- **Customer portals** - Create dedicated teams for external customers with limited, customized access to their own data
- **Multi-tenant applications** - Isolate data and interfaces for different clients or business units
- **Partner access** - Provide partners with tailored views into relevant data without exposing everything
