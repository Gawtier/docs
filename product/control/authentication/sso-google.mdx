## Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Access Google Admin Console

Navigate to your Google account and log into the Admin console, then proceed to **Apps → Web and mobile apps**.

### Step 2: Create Custom SAML Application

Select **Add App → Add custom SAML app** and follow the configuration wizard.

### Step 3: Configure Service Provider Details

Enter the following information in the Service Provider Details window:

- **ACS URL**: `https://api.forestadmin.com/api/saml/callback` (this receives the SAML response)
- **Entity ID**: The globally unique identifier that Forest Admin provides
- **Start URL**: Optional parameter used for setting the RelayState in SAML requests, supporting IDP-initiated login redirection

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, verify:

- All endpoint information is accurate
- Certificate expiration dates remain valid
- The Name ID (primary email) configured on your Identity Provider matches the email address used in Forest Admin accounts
