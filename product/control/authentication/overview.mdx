## Authentication Methods

Forest Admin supports multiple authentication methods to access your admin panel:

### Email and Password

The default authentication method. Users create an account with their email address and password to access Forest Admin.

### Google Sign-In

Users can authenticate using their Google account for faster access without managing separate credentials.

## Accessing Organization Settings

To configure authentication, security, and other organization-level settings:

1. Click your **Gravatar** in the bottom-left corner
2. Select **Organization Settings**
3. Navigate to the appropriate tab:
   - **SSO** - Configure Single Sign-On with identity providers
   - **Security** - Manage IP whitelisting, 2FA enforcement, session timeouts
   - **SCIM** - Set up automatic user provisioning

## Single Sign-On (SSO)

Single Sign-On allows your team to authenticate using your organization's existing identity provider, centralizing access control and improving security.

### Benefits

- **Centralized authentication** - Users sign in once to access all corporate applications
- **Enhanced security** - Leverage your IdP's security policies and MFA requirements
- **Simplified management** - User access is controlled from your identity provider
- **Audit trail** - Track authentication events through your IdP

### How SSO Works

1. User attempts to access Forest Admin
2. Forest Admin redirects to your identity provider
3. User authenticates with your IdP (using corporate credentials)
4. IdP sends authentication confirmation to Forest Admin
5. User gains access to Forest Admin with appropriate permissions

## SCIM Provisioning

SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) automatically provisions and deprovisions users from your identity provider to Forest Admin.

### Benefits

- **Automatic user management** - New employees are automatically added to Forest Admin
- **Immediate deprovisioning** - Users are removed when they leave your organization
- **Reduced overhead** - No manual user management required
- **Compliance** - Ensures access is always synchronized with your IdP

### Prerequisites

Before configuring SCIM:
- SSO must be enabled and configured for your organization
- You must have admin access to both Forest Admin and your identity provider

### What SCIM Syncs

- **User updates** - Name and email changes are synchronized
- **User deactivation** - Removed or deactivated users lose Forest Admin access
- **Group membership** - User assignments to teams (when supported)
