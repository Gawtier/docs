## Supported Features

The manual Okta SCIM integration enables:
- User provisioning from Okta to Forest Admin
- Updating user role, permission level, and tags
- User deletion when removed from the Okta app
- Team assignment via groups

## Setup Steps

### 1. Add Forest Admin App

Navigate to Applications > Browse App Catalog, then select "SCIMForest 2.0 Test App (Header Auth)". Name the application, keeping in mind each app links to one Forest Admin project.

### 2. Authentication

Generate a provisioning token in Forest Admin project settings. In Okta's Integration tab, enter the token prefixed with "Bearer" (format: "Bearer [token]").

### 3. Configuration

Keep "Sync Password" disabled as it's unsupported.

### 4. Custom Parameters

Four parameters require configuration:
- `permissionLevel`: Admin, Developer, Editor, or User
- `teams`: comma-separated team names (e.g., "Operators,Support")
- `role`: must match existing project roles
- `tags`: optional key/value pairs separated by semicolons

### 5. Attribute Setup

In Profile Editor, set external namespace to `urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:forest:2.0:User`

### 6. Mapping Rules

Create rules directing Okta to Forest Admin for automatic `role`, `permissionLevel`, and `tags` assignment.

### 7. Group Management

Configure Directory groups for team mapping, then use "Push Groups" to link Okta groups with Forest Admin teams. Optional: disable automatic team renaming in app settings.
