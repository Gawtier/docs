## Overview

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) enforcement allows organizations to enforce a second authentication factor while login to specific environments.

<Info>
This feature may not be available on all plans. Check the [pricing page](https://www.forestadmin.com/pricing) for more information, or [contact us](https://www.forestadmin.com/contact) to enable it.

## How 2FA Enforcement Works

While 2FA is available platform-wide in Forest Admin, the Security tab allows you to make 2FA mandatory before users can access specific environments.

## Third-Party Login Providers

<Warning>
For users who log in through third-party providers, ensure that 2FA is enabled on that provider to maintain security parity.
</Warning>

When using third-party login providers (such as Google, Microsoft, etc.), the 2FA security must be configured at the provider level to ensure consistent protection.

## Configuration

To enforce 2FA for specific environments:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Security Settings">
    Go to **Project Settings** > **Security Tab**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure 2FA Enforcement">
    Select the environments where 2FA should be mandatory
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Settings">
    Save your configuration to enforce 2FA requirements
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once configured, users will be required to complete two-factor authentication before accessing the specified environments.
