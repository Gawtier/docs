Forest Admin is built with security and privacy at its core. Your data never transits through Forest Admin servers, and you maintain complete control over your infrastructure and access policies.

## Data Privacy

### Private by Design

Forest Admin implements a **privacy-first architecture** where your sensitive data flows directly between your Agent and user browsers, never passing through Forest Admin servers.

**How it works:**

When users access the Forest Admin UI, their browser establishes two separate connections:

1. **Forest Admin servers:** Retrieves layout configuration, UI settings, and metadata
2. **Your Agent:** Retrieves actual data from your database

```
┌─────────────┐
│   User's    │
│   Browser   │
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ├────────────────┐
       │                │
       ▼                ▼
┌─────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐
│   Forest    │   │  Your Agent  │
│   Servers   │   │   (Your      │
│   (UI/      │   │  Infrastructure)
│  Layout)    │   │              │
└─────────────┘   └──────┬───────┘
                         │
                         ▼
                  ┌──────────────┐
                  │  Your        │
                  │  Database    │
                  └──────────────┘
```

**What Forest Admin sees:**
- UI layouts and configurations
- User authentication metadata (email, role, permissions)
- API request logs (endpoints called, timestamps)

**What Forest Admin never sees:**
- Your actual data (customer records, transactions, etc.)
- Database credentials
- Your `FOREST_AUTH_SECRET`

<Info>
This architecture ensures your sensitive information remains protected within your infrastructure at all times.
</Info>

### No Third-Party Tracking

Forest Admin guarantees data privacy across all plan levels:

- **No data sharing:** Your data is never sold or shared with third parties
- **No third-party analytics on data:** Forest Admin doesn't track or analyze your business data
- **Optional tracking control:** Organizations on the **Pro plan** can disable third-party vendors that might track activity metadata from browsers

<Tip>
**Pro plan feature:** Disable all third-party tracking scripts in your Forest Admin project settings to ensure complete privacy for your team's activity.
</Tip>

## Security Measures

### Token-Based Authentication

Forest Admin uses a **dual-token authentication system** to secure both UI access and Agent communication.

#### FOREST_ENV_SECRET

Authenticates requests between your Agent and Forest Admin servers.

**Purpose:**
- Links your Agent to your Forest Admin project
- Authenticates layout and configuration requests
- Required for all architectures (Cloud, Self-Hosted, On-Premise)

**Security notes:**
- Generated by Forest Admin
- Unique per environment (development, staging, production)
- Should be stored as an environment variable

<CodeGroup>
```bash .env
FOREST_ENV_SECRET=1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
Never commit `FOREST_ENV_SECRET` to version control. Always use environment variables or secret management tools.
</Warning>

#### FOREST_AUTH_SECRET

Authenticates requests between user browsers and your Agent (Self-Hosted and On-Premise only).

**Purpose:**
- Signs JWT tokens for user authentication
- Validates requests to your Agent
- **Your choice** - Forest Admin never knows this secret

**Security notes:**
- Generated by you (not Forest Admin)
- Should be at least 32 characters long
- Unique per environment
- Used only in Self-Hosted and On-Premise architectures

<CodeGroup>
```bash Generate a secure secret
# Using Node.js
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"

# Using OpenSSL
openssl rand -hex 32
```

```bash .env
FOREST_AUTH_SECRET=your-secure-random-string-at-least-32-characters-long
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
**Cloud architecture:** `FOREST_AUTH_SECRET` is not needed because authentication is handled by Forest Admin servers. Your data still flows directly from your Agent to browsers without passing through Forest Admin.
</Info>

### JWT Token Structure

Both tokens are JSON Web Tokens (JWT) containing user context:

**Token payload includes:**
- User ID
- Email
- Full name
- Role
- Team
- Tags
- Permissions

**Use cases for token data:**
- Custom authorization logic in your Agent
- Audit logging
- Dynamic filtering based on user context
- Integration with your internal systems

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node.js - Access user context
agent.customizeCollection('orders', collection => {
  collection.addHook('Before', 'List', async (context) => {
    const { email, role } = context.caller;

    // Custom logic based on user context
    if (role !== 'admin') {
      context.filter = { user_email: email };
    }
  });
});
```

```ruby Ruby - Access user context
collection.add_hook(:Before, :List) do |context|
  email = context.caller.email
  role = context.caller.role

  # Custom logic based on user context
  unless role == 'admin'
    context.filter = { user_email: email }
  end
end
```

```python Python - Access user context
@collection.add_hook('Before', 'List')
def filter_by_user(context):
    email = context.caller.email
    role = context.caller.role

    # Custom logic based on user context
    if role != 'admin':
        context.filter = {'user_email': email}
```
</CodeGroup>

### IP Whitelisting

Organizations can restrict access by creating trusted IP address lists, controlling both UI access and Agent interactions.

**How it works:**
1. Define allowed IP addresses or ranges in Forest Admin settings
2. Forest Admin blocks UI access from non-whitelisted IPs
3. Your Agent can optionally validate IP addresses for additional security

**Use cases:**
- Restrict access to office networks
- Allow only VPN connections
- Enforce geographic restrictions
- Compliance requirements (SOC 2, HIPAA, etc.)

For detailed configuration, see [IP Whitelisting](/product/control/security/ip-whitelisting).

### Infrastructure Flexibility

You maintain **complete control** over your Agent deployment:

**Deployment options:**
- **DMZ (Demilitarized Zone):** Deploy Agent in isolated network segment
- **VPN:** Require VPN connection to access Agent
- **Private Cloud:** Deploy within your private cloud infrastructure
- **On-Premise:** Keep everything within your data center

**Network security:**
- Configure firewall rules
- Set up network segmentation
- Implement reverse proxies
- Use TLS/SSL for all connections

<Tip>
**Best practice:** Deploy your Agent behind a VPN or firewall to add an additional layer of security. Even if an attacker obtains valid credentials, they would still need network access to reach your Agent.
</Tip>

### HTTPS/TLS Encryption

All communication is encrypted:

- **Browser ↔ Forest Admin:** HTTPS with TLS 1.2+
- **Browser ↔ Your Agent:** HTTPS (you configure)
- **Agent ↔ Forest Admin:** HTTPS with TLS 1.2+

<Warning>
Always deploy your Agent with HTTPS enabled in production. Never use HTTP for sensitive data.
</Warning>

   - Use separate secrets for each environment (dev, staging, prod)
   - Rotate secrets regularly (every 90 days)
   - Store secrets in secure vaults (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.)
   - Never commit secrets to version control

2. **Network security:**
   - Deploy Agent behind VPN or firewall
   - Use HTTPS/TLS for all connections
   - Implement IP whitelisting for additional protection
   - Configure proper CORS policies

3. **Access control:**
   - Use role-based permissions
   - Implement least privilege principle
   - Review user access regularly
   - Enable 2FA for all users

4. **Monitoring:**
   - Enable audit logging
   - Monitor authentication attempts
   - Track data access patterns
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activity

5. **Updates:**
   - Keep Agent version up to date
   - Monitor security advisories
   - Test updates in staging first
   - Have a rollback plan
