## Overview

IP Whitelisting enables administrators to control which IP addresses can access your admin panel. This feature restricts panel access to approved IP addresses only.

<Info>
This feature may not be available on all plans. Check the [pricing page](https://www.forestadmin.com/pricing) for more information, or [contact us](https://www.forestadmin.com/contact) to enable it.

## How It Works

When IP Whitelisting is enabled, Forest Admin restricts access to your admin panel to only those IP addresses that have been explicitly whitelisted. Users attempting to access from non-whitelisted IP addresses will be blocked.

## Configuration

To configure IP Whitelisting:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Security Settings">
    Go to **Project Settings** > **Security Tab** > **IP Whitelisting**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable IP Whitelisting">
    Turn on the IP Whitelisting feature
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Approved IP Addresses">
    Add the IP addresses that should have access to your admin panel
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Settings">
    Save your configuration to enforce IP restrictions
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Once IP Whitelisting is enabled and enforced, users connecting from IP addresses not on the whitelist will be unable to access the admin panel. Ensure all necessary IP addresses are added before enforcement.
</Warning>
