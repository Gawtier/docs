## Overview

The Activity tab provides a comprehensive view of team activities within Forest Admin. Every action performed by users is tracked and logged with complete context for accountability and compliance.

## What Gets Logged

Forest Admin tracks all user activities across different areas:

| Category | Activities |
|----------|-----------|
| **Data Operations** | `create` - Record creation<br/>`update` - Record updates<br/>`delete` - Record deletion |
| **Smart Actions** | `action` - Smart Action execution<br/>`createApproval` - Approval request created<br/>`approveApproval` - Approval granted<br/>`rejectApproval` - Approval rejected<br/>`markApprovalAsFailed` - Approval failed<br/>`ignoreApprovalWarning` - Warning bypassed<br/>`sendApprovalBackInReview` - Sent back for review |
| **Inbox Management** | `startProcessingInboxTask` - Task processing started<br/>`assignUserToInboxTask` - Task assigned<br/>`unassignUserFromInboxTask` - Task unassigned<br/>`cancelInboxTask` - Task cancelled<br/>`autoCancelInboxTask` - Task auto-cancelled |
| **Workflows** | `triggerWorkflow` - Workflow initiated<br/>`completeWorkflowStep` - Step completed<br/>`selectWorkflowOption` - Option selected<br/>`reviseWorkflowStep` - Step revised<br/>`resumeWorkflow` - Workflow resumed<br/>`completeWorkflow` - Workflow finished<br/>`abortWorkflow` - Workflow aborted |
| **Collaboration** | `createNote` - Note added<br/>`deleteNote` - Note removed<br/>`createMessage` - Message sent |

For each action, the system logs the **user, targeted record(s), and timestamp**. Forest Admin tracks and stores these activities **without records' sensitive data** except the ID/primary key.

<Warning>
**Known Limitation**: When collections share identical names with different capitalization (e.g., `myCollection` and `MyCollection`), activity tracking may incorrectly attribute actions between these collections.
</Warning>

Access the Activity tab to see all team activities across your Forest Admin project. The logs show all actions with user information, affected records, and timestamps.

### Record-Level Activity

Individual records display their own activity history through a dedicated Activity tab on each record's detail page, enabling team members to track specific record changes over time.
