The **Integration** layer is the foundation of Forest Admin. It determines what data is available in your admin panel and how it's structured.

## How data flows into Forest Admin

Forest Admin loads data through **datasources** - connections to your databases, APIs, or any system that stores data. The agent introspects your datasources to automatically discover tables, collections, and their relationships.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node.js
const agent = createAgent(options);

// Connect your primary database
agent.addDataSource(
  createSqlDataSource('postgresql://localhost/mydb')
);

// Forest Admin automatically:
// - Discovers all tables
// - Detects column types
// - Identifies relationships (foreign keys)
// - Creates collections for each table
```

```ruby Ruby
agent = Forestadmin::Agent.new(options)

# Connect your primary database
agent.add_datasource(
  Forestadmin::Datasource::ActiveRecord.new
)

# Forest Admin automatically:
# - Discovers all tables
# - Detects column types
# - Identifies relationships (foreign keys)
# - Creates collections for each table
```
</CodeGroup>

### What gets loaded

When you connect a datasource, Forest Admin **introspects** it to understand its structure. The introspection method differs based on how you connect:

**ORM-based connections** (Sequelize, Mongoose):
- Forest Admin reads your ORM model definitions
- Uses the schemas you've already defined in your application code
- Detects relationships from model associations
- No database introspection needed - everything comes from your models

**Direct database connections** (SQL, MongoDB):
- **SQL databases**: Forest Admin queries the database metadata (information_schema or system catalogs) to discover tables, columns, data types, constraints, foreign keys, and indexes
- **MongoDB**: Forest Admin samples a subset of documents (default: 100 per collection) and analyzes them to infer the schema structure, including nested fields and references

Once introspection is complete, Forest Admin automatically:

1. **Discovers schema** - all tables/collections and their structure
2. **Maps data types** - converts database types to Forest Admin types
3. **Detects relationships** - foreign keys or references become navigable relationships
4. **Creates collections** - each table/collection becomes a collection in the UI
5. **Enables CRUD operations** - browse, create, edit, delete records

## Loading more data: multi-datasources

Connect multiple databases or APIs in the same agent:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node.js
// Primary PostgreSQL database
agent.addDataSource(
  createSqlDataSource('postgresql://localhost/main'),
  { name: 'main' }
);

// MongoDB for analytics
agent.addDataSource(
  createMongooseDataSource(mongoConnection),
  { name: 'analytics' }
);
```

```ruby Ruby
# Primary PostgreSQL database
agent.add_datasource(
  Forestadmin::Datasource::ActiveRecord.new,
  name: 'main'
)

# MongoDB for analytics
agent.add_datasource(
  Forestadmin::Datasource::Mongoid.new,
  name: 'analytics'
)
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
**Looking to enrich a single record?**

If you want to add computed fields or fetch external data to enrich individual records (not load entire collections), use **Smart Fields** instead of adding a datasource.

## Architecture choices

Your architecture determines where the agent runs and how it accesses your data:

| Architecture | Agent location | UI location | Best for |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| **Self-Hosted** | Your infrastructure | Forest Admin servers | Most popular - full control over data access |
| **Cloud** | Forest Admin servers | Forest Admin servers | Fastest setup - Forest Admin connects directly |
| **On-Premise** | Your infrastructure | Your infrastructure | Enterprise - complete air-gapped deployment |
