description: "Get started in 5 minutes with fully-managed Forest Admin Cloud - no infrastructure required"
---

The Cloud architecture is Forest Admin's fully-managed solution where everything is hosted for you. Connect your database and start building your admin panel in minutes without any infrastructure setup.

## Architecture Overview

<img src="/assets/architecture-cloud.svg" alt="Cloud Architecture Diagram" />

### How it Works

1. **Your users** access the Forest Admin UI hosted at `app.forestadmin.com`
2. **Forest Admin Cloud** hosts both the agent and UI
3. **Cloud agent** connects to your database using credentials you provide
4. **Your database** must be network-accessible to Forest Admin's servers
5. **All queries** are executed from Forest Admin's infrastructure

<Info>
**Perfect for**: Quick prototypes, internal tools, and simple CRUD operations where you don't need custom code.
</Info>

## Limitations

### Native datasources only

Cloud mode only supports native database connections (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, SQL Server, SQLite). You cannot use:

- **Community datasources** (Hubspot, Elasticsearch, etc.)
- **Custom datasources** (APIs, third-party services)
- **Multi-datasources** (connecting multiple databases)

For these advanced data source options, use [Self-Hosted architecture](/product/integration/architectures/self-hosted).

### Limited environment management

Cloud mode has a simplified environment workflow:

- **Development environment only** - No staging or multiple production environments
- **No branch-based workflow** - Cannot use Forest CLI for branch management
- **No environment promotion** - Cannot promote changes between environments

For full developer workflow with staging environments and branch management, use [Self-Hosted architecture](/product/integration/architectures/self-hosted).

### Database Must Be Network Accessible

Your database must accept connections from Forest Admin's IP address:

```
Required: Allow inbound connections from Forest Admin
- Whitelist IP: 35.180.175.97
- Your database needs a public endpoint or VPN
- Cannot use localhost or internal-only databases
```

<Info>
**Forest Admin Cloud IP to whitelist**: `35.180.175.97`
</Info>

### Data Queries Through Forest Admin

Unlike self-hosted where your agent queries your database directly, Cloud mode queries go through Forest Admin's servers:

```
Self-Hosted:  Your Agent → Your Database (direct)
Cloud:        Forest Admin Cloud → Your Database (external)
```

This means:
- Slightly higher latency
- Data in transit goes through Forest Admin
- Subject to Forest Admin's availability

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I use Cloud mode with a local database?">
    No, Cloud mode requires your database to be network-accessible. For local databases, use [Self-Hosted architecture](/product/integration/architectures/self-hosted) instead.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is my data secure in Cloud mode?">
    Yes. Forest Admin uses TLS encryption for all connections. However, data does transit through Forest Admin's servers. For maximum security with data sovereignty, use [Self-Hosted](/product/integration/architectures/self-hosted) or [On-Premise](/product/integration/architectures/on-premise).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I switch from Cloud to Self-Hosted later?">
    Yes! You can migrate your configuration and settings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the IP addresses to whitelist?">
    Contact [Forest Admin support](https://www.forestadmin.com/contact) to get the current list of IP addresses for whitelisting.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use Cloud mode in production?">
    Cloud mode is suitable for production use cases that don't require custom code. For production applications with custom business logic, we recommend [Self-Hosted architecture](/product/integration/architectures/self-hosted).
