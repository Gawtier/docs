title: "On-Premise Architecture"
description: "Full control with UI, backend, and agent hosted in your infrastructure - enterprise deployment option"
---

The on-premise architecture provides complete control by hosting **everything** in your own infrastructure: the UI, the backend, and the agent.

## What gets hosted on-premise

In an on-premise setup, you host:

- **Forest Admin UI** - The admin interface accessible to your users
- **Forest Admin Backend** - The Forest Admin application server
- **Your Agent** - The Forest Admin agent connecting to your database
- **Your Database** - Your existing database

Everything stays within your infrastructure with no external dependencies.

## When to choose on-premise

On-premise is ideal for organizations with:

- **Strict data sovereignty requirements** - Data cannot leave your infrastructure
- **Air-gapped environments** - No internet connectivity required
- **Regulatory compliance needs** - HIPAA, FedRAMP, or other strict regulations
- **Enterprise security policies** - Complete control over all components
