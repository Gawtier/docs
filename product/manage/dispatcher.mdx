# Dispatcher

The Dispatcher feature in Forest Admin helps you distribute work efficiently across your team by automatically assigning tasks and records to team members.

## Overview

Dispatcher allows you to:
- Automatically assign records to team members based on rules
- Balance workload across your team
- Track assignment history
- Set up round-robin or rule-based assignment strategies

## How it works

The Dispatcher integrates with the **Assign to** action to automatically route records to the right team member based on your defined rules.
