## Accessing Interface Settings

1. Click your **project logo** in the top-left corner
2. Select **Project Settings**
3. Navigate to the **Interface** tab

## Available Customization Options

### Project Logo

Set your own project logo which will appear in the top-left corner of your Forest Admin interface, replacing the default Forest Admin branding.

**Requirements:**
- Recommended format: PNG or SVG
- Recommended dimensions: 120x40 pixels for optimal display
- File size: Maximum 2MB

### Primary Color

Customize the primary color applied throughout the application interface, including:
- Buttons
- Links
- Active states
- Navigation highlights

This allows you to match Forest Admin's color scheme to your company's brand guidelines.

### Custom Domain

Instead of accessing your Forest Admin instance through the default `app.forestadmin.com/12345` URL, you can configure a custom domain.

**Examples:**
- `forestadmin.my-company.com`
- `admin.my-company.com`
- Any custom domain you own

#### Setting Up a Custom Domain

1. Choose your desired subdomain or domain
2. Configure DNS settings with your domain provider:
   - Add a CNAME record pointing to the Forest Admin server
   - Specific DNS instructions are provided in the Interface tab
3. Enter your custom domain in the Interface settings
4. Wait for DNS propagation (usually 24-48 hours)
5. Access your Forest Admin instance via your custom domain

<Info>
SSL certificates are automatically provisioned for custom domains to ensure secure connections.
