## Description

Segments are saved filters that let you organize and categorize your data into meaningful groups.

This page covers the concept of Segments. For implementation:
- **Creating Segments (UI):** [Creating Segments](/product/process/segments/creating-segments)
- **Coding Smart Segments:** [Smart Segments](/product/process/segments/smart-segments/overview)

## Sources to migrate

- `documentation-user-guide/collections/segments.md`
- `developer-guide-agent-v2/sources/agent-customization/segments/`
- `documentation-cloud/sources/ui-customization/segments.md`

## Content outline

1. **What are Segments?**
   - Saved filters
   - Data categorization
   - Pre-defined views
   - Simple Segments vs Smart Segments

2. **Common Use Cases**
   - Active/Inactive users
   - Order status groups
   - Priority categorization
   - Time-based segments (recent, old)
   - Geographic segments

3. **Two Ways to Work with Segments**
   - **Creating Segments (UI)** - Filter-based segments (for all users)
   - **Smart Segments** - Complex logic with code (for developers)

4. **How Segments Work**
   - Filter conditions
   - Dynamic updates
   - Performance considerations

5. **Next Steps**
   - [Creating Segments in UI](/product/process/segments/creating-segments)
   - [Coding Smart Segments](/product/process/segments/smart-segments/overview)

## Migration notes

- Segments appear in Build section for UI configuration
- This section focuses on segment logic/implementation
- Cross-reference between Build and Process
