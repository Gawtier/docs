description: Trigger custom operations on your data across Forest Admin
---

Actions are interactive buttons in Forest Admin that execute operations on your data. They enable you to implement business logic, integrate with external services, and automate workflows directly from your admin panel.

## What are actions?

An action is a button that appears in the Forest Admin interface. When clicked, it triggers custom logic - from simple field updates to complex multi-step workflows.

Actions let you:

- Execute business operations (approve orders, ban users, send invoices)
- Integrate with external services (Stripe, SendGrid, Slack)
- Automate workflows (notifications, data synchronization)
- Process data (bulk updates, exports, transformations)
- Implement approval processes
- Trigger webhooks to third-party tools

## Where actions appear

Actions are available throughout Forest Admin:

- **Collection view**: Actions on records in table and detail views (single, bulk, or global actions)
- **Workspaces**: Trigger actions from custom dashboards

## Built-in actions

Forest Admin provides native actions out-of-the-box:

| Action | Description | Scope |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Create** | Add a new record | Global |
| **Update** | Edit record fields | Single / Bulk |
| **Delete** | Remove records | Single / Bulk |
| **Duplicate** | Copy an existing record | Single |
| **Export** | Download data as CSV | Bulk / Global |
| **Assign to** | Assign records to team members | Single / Bulk |

These work automatically with your data structure and require no configuration.

<Note>
The **Assign to** action is part of Forest Admin's [Dispatcher](/product/collaborate/inbox-dispatcher) feature for task management.
</Note>

## Custom actions

Beyond built-in actions, you can create your own custom actions in two ways:

### No-code actions

Connect Forest Admin to external services without writing code:

- **Webhooks**: Call APIs with Make, n8n, Zapier
- **Update fields**: Change record values directly from the UI
- **Simple workflows**: Trigger external automations

Perfect for non-technical teams and simple operations.

### Code-based actions

Build advanced actions with custom code in your backend:

- **Complex business logic**: Multi-step workflows, validations
- **Dynamic forms**: Forms that adapt to user input
- **External integrations**: Deep API integrations
- **File generation**: Create PDFs, CSVs, reports
- **Custom result types**: HTML responses, redirects, downloads

For developers who need full control and flexibility.

## Action scopes

Every action has a **scope** that defines when it's available:

| Scope | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Single** | Operates on one specific record | Send a password reset email to a user |
| **Bulk** | Operates on multiple selected records | Archive 50 selected orders at once |
| **Global** | Operates at collection level without selecting records | Import customers from a CSV file |

## Action types

Customize the appearance of action buttons to match their purpose:

| Type | Color | Use case |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Default** | Gray | Standard operations |
| **Info** | Blue | Informational actions |
| **Success** | Green | Positive actions (approve, confirm) |
| **Warning** | Orange | Actions requiring attention |
| **Danger** | Red | Destructive actions (delete, ban) |
| **Neutral** | Light gray | Secondary actions |

The button color helps users quickly identify the nature of an action before executing it.

## Action visibility

Control when and where actions appear in your interface.

**Role-based permissions** determine which users can see and execute specific actions. Configure permissions per team and role to restrict sensitive operations. See [Roles & permissions](/product/control/roles-permissions) for configuration.

**Conditional visibility** allows actions to appear only when certain conditions are met. Show actions based on segment membership, specific field values, or custom permission logic.

**Approval workflows** can require validation from another authorized user before execution. This adds a review step for critical operations. See [Approval workflows](/product/collaborate/approval-workflows) for more information.

## Making actions visible

After creating a code-based action in your codebase, you need to make it visible in the Forest Admin interface:

1. **Deploy your code** (or save in Cloud editor if using Forest Admin Cloud)
2. **Enable Layout Editor mode** in Forest Admin
3. **Go to Collection Settings** (gear icon) → Actions tab
4. **Find your action** and toggle it to **Visible**
5. **Configure permissions** for each role

<Note>
Actions are only visible if they are marked as "visible" in the UI and the user's role has "trigger" permission.
</Note>

## What actions enable

### Approval workflows

Actions integrate with Forest Admin's approval system. Require manager approval before execution, track approval history, and maintain an audit trail of who approved what.

### Role-based permissions

Control who can execute actions by configuring permissions per team and role. Show actions only when conditions are met and restrict sensitive operations.
