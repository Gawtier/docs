description: Create actions with webhooks and integrations - no coding required
---

No-code actions let you create powerful operations directly from the Forest Admin interface, without writing any code. Connect to external services like Make, n8n, or Zapier, or simply update field values with a click.

Perfect for non-technical teams and simple operations that don't require custom business logic.

<Note>
For advanced actions with custom code, dynamic forms, or complex logic, see [Code-based actions](/product/process/actions/custom-actions/overview).
</Note>

## What you can do

No-code actions support two main behaviors.

**Update record fields** lets you directly change field values on records. You can set a status to "approved", mark items as archived, update timestamps, or toggle boolean flags with a single click.

**Call external APIs** triggers webhooks to external services. This enables integration with automation platforms like Make, n8n, or Zapier, your own API endpoints, or any third-party service that accepts HTTP requests.

## Integration with automation tools

No-code actions work seamlessly with popular automation platforms:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Make">
    1. Create a webhook in Make
    2. Copy the webhook URL
    3. In Forest Admin, create an action with "Call an API"
    4. Paste the webhook URL
    5. Make receives the payload and continues your workflow
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="n8n">
    1. Create a webhook node in n8n
    2. Copy the webhook URL
    3. In Forest Admin, create an action with "Call an API"
    4. Paste the webhook URL
    5. n8n processes the data through your workflow
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Zapier">
    1. Create a "Webhooks by Zapier" trigger
    2. Copy the webhook URL
    3. In Forest Admin, create an action with "Call an API"
    4. Paste the webhook URL
    5. Zapier triggers your Zap
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Creating an action

To create an action from the UI:

1. Enable **Layout Editor mode** in your Forest Admin interface
2. Access the collection settings (gear icon)
3. Navigate to the **Actions** tab
4. Click **Create Action**

## Action configuration

### Basic settings

When creating an action, configure the following:

#### Name

The action name that will appear on the button. Choose a clear, action-oriented name (e.g., "Send Email", "Mark as Shipped", "Ban User").

#### Scope

Choose the scope that matches your use case. See [Action scopes](/product/process/actions/overview#action-scopes) for details.

## Action behavior

### Update record

The simplest action type updates specific fields on a record.

**Example:** Ban a user by setting `is_blocked` to `true`

1. Select **Update record** as the action behavior
2. Choose the field to update (e.g., `is_blocked`)
3. Set the target value (e.g., `true`)
4. Click **Save**

### Call an API

Trigger HTTP requests to your API or external services (Zapier, Make, n8n).

**Webhook payload format:**

<CodeGroup>
```json Single action
{
  "action": {
    "name": "Send email",
    "scope": "single"
  },
  "record": {
    "id": 1
  }
}
```

```json Bulk action
{
  "action": {
    "name": "Send email",
    "scope": "bulk"
  },
  "records": [
    { "id": 1 },
    { "id": 2 }
  ]
}
```

```json Global action
{
  "action": {
    "name": "Generate report",
    "scope": "global"
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

**Configuration:**

1. Select **Call an API** as the action behavior
2. Enter your webhook URL
3. Choose HTTP method (usually `POST`)
4. Add headers if needed
5. The payload will be sent automatically

## Need more flexibility?

No-code actions are perfect for simple operations, but if you need complex business logic, dynamic forms, or custom validation, you'll want to use code-based actions instead.
