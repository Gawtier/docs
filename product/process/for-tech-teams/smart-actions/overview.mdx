## Description

Smart Actions let you create custom operations on your data - from simple buttons to complex workflows.

**This page covers SHARED concepts.** For implementation details, see:
- [Cloud implementation](/product/process/for-tech-teams/smart-actions/cloud)
- [Node.js implementation](/product/process/for-tech-teams/smart-actions/nodejs)
- [Ruby implementation](/product/process/for-tech-teams/smart-actions/ruby)
- [Python implementation](/product/process/for-tech-teams/smart-actions/python)

## Sources to migrate

- `developer-guide-agent-v2/sources/agent-customization/actions/README.md` (main concepts)
- `documentation-agent-v1/reference-guide/actions/README.md` (v1 concepts)
- `documentation-user-guide/collections/actions/create-and-manage-smart-actions.md` (UI perspective)
- `documentation-cloud/sources/code-customization/actions/README.md` (Cloud version)

## Content outline

1. **What are Smart Actions?**
   - Custom operations beyond CRUD
   - Triggered by users via buttons in UI
   - Execute business logic on your backend
   - Examples: Send email, Refund payment, Generate report, Approve request

2. **When to use Smart Actions**
   - External API calls (Stripe, Slack, etc.)
   - Complex workflows (multi-step processes)
   - Bulk operations (update 100 records)
   - Approval workflows
   - Data validation/cleanup
   - Custom business logic

3. **Types of Smart Actions**
   - **Single:** Act on one record
   - **Bulk:** Act on multiple selected records
   - **Global:** Act on collection (no record selection)

4. **Key Concepts**
   - **Scope:** Single vs Bulk vs Global
   - **Context:** Access to selected records, user info, request data
   - **Forms:** Input fields for user parameters
   - **Result Builder:** Return success/error messages
   - **Hooks:** Before/after action execution

5. **Smart Actions vs Built-in Actions**
   - Built-in: CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
   - Smart: Everything custom
   - Smart Actions complement, don't replace, built-in actions

6. **How Smart Actions Work** (high-level flow)
   1. User clicks button in UI
   2. (Optional) Form is displayed for input
   3. Request sent to your backend
   4. Your code executes (API calls, database updates, etc.)
   5. Result returned to UI (success/error message)
   6. UI refreshes data if needed

7. **Basic Example** (pseudo-code, not framework-specific)
   ```
   Action: "Send Welcome Email"
   Scope: Single
   Execute:
     - Get user email from record
     - Call email service
     - Return success message
   ```

8. **Implementation by Framework**
   - **Cloud:** [Serverless functions](/product/process/for-tech-teams/smart-actions/cloud)
   - **Node.js:** [Collection.addAction()](/product/process/for-tech-teams/smart-actions/nodejs)
   - **Ruby:** [Collection.add_action()](/product/process/for-tech-teams/smart-actions/ruby)
   - **Python:** [Collection.add_action()](/product/process/for-tech-teams/smart-actions/python)

9. **What's Next?**
   - Choose your framework and see implementation guide
   - Learn about [Smart Fields](/product/process/for-tech-teams/smart-fields/overview)
   - See [Smart Action examples](./nodejs.md#examples) (in framework pages)

## Migration notes

- **CRITICAL:** This is the SHARED overview - NO framework-specific code here
- Heavily duplicated across 5 repos (user-guide, agent-v1, agent-v2, cloud) - consolidate into ONE source of truth
- Link to framework-specific pages for implementation
- Examples should be pseudo-code or conceptual, not real code
- Emphasize the "why" and "when", not the "how" (that's in framework pages)
