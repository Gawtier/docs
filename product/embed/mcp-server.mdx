# MCP Server

Forest Admin provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that allows AI assistants and tools to interact with your admin panel programmatically.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard for connecting AI assistants to external data sources and tools. Forest Admin's MCP server enables AI tools like Claude to:

- Query and browse your data
- Execute actions on records
- Access collection schemas
- Retrieve business context

## Installation

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @forestadmin/mcp-server
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @forestadmin/mcp-server
```
</CodeGroup>

## Configuration

Configure the MCP server in your AI tool's settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "forestadmin": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@forestadmin/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "FOREST_ENV_SECRET": "your-environment-secret",
        "FOREST_SERVER_URL": "your-server-url"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Available Tools

The MCP server exposes the following capabilities:

### Data Access
- **Browse collections**: View available collections and their schemas
- **Query records**: Search and filter records across collections
- **Read relationships**: Access related data through relationships

### Actions
- **Execute actions**: Run Smart Actions on records
- **Bulk operations**: Perform operations on multiple records
- **Approval workflows**: Interact with approval workflows

### Context
- **Schema information**: Get collection and field definitions
- **Business rules**: Access validation rules and constraints
- **User permissions**: Check what operations are allowed

## Use Cases

### AI-Assisted Operations
Use Claude or other AI assistants to:
- Answer questions about your data
- Generate reports and insights
- Automate routine tasks
- Perform data analysis

### Example Prompts

> "Show me all pending orders from the last 24 hours"

> "What customers have the highest lifetime value?"

> "Execute the 'Send Invoice' action on order #12345"

## Security

The MCP server:
- Respects all Forest Admin permissions and roles
- Uses your environment's authentication
- Logs all operations for audit purposes
- Never exposes sensitive data without proper access

<Warning>
Only provide MCP server access to trusted AI tools and users. The server can perform any operation that the authenticated user can perform.
